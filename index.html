        <div class="cos-modal">
          <p>
           We are pleased to announce that the 22nd International Workshop on Physical Processes in Natural Waters (PPNW2019) will be held in Yichang, China. The workshop is co-hosted by Hubei University of Technology and Three Gorges University.
            <br>
            <br>
           The PPNW workshops focus on the physics of inland and coastal water bodies and their interactions with the physical and biogeochemical processes that drive water quality and ecosystem functioning. The 22nd workshop in Yichang will pay special attention to the physics and functioning of freshwaters in light of global environmental change (eutrophication and climate change). We invite abstracts on topics addressing such changes in the context of physical-biogeochemical interactions, biogeochemical cycles, greenhouse gases and general limnology. PPNW is an open workshop, actively seeking to expand contact and collaboration with neighboring fields such as physical oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and engineering. With 40 to 60 participants and a small number of invited speakers, the PPNW meetings are characterized by their active workshop atmosphere and a comfortable time frame for presentations and discussion.

          Dr. Kettner received a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering & Geosciences (2007) at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands where he studied local and global fluvial supply dynamics to the coastal zone. With numerical models he investigates the impact of long-term climate and sea-level controls on riverine water and sediment fluxes and how these fluxes change over time. On shorter timescales, Kettner focuses on anthropogenic changes (e.g. altering of land use and placement of reservoirs) and how these impact water discharge and sediment flux.<br/>
          Dr. Kettner has been from the beginning (2006) intimitly involved in the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) at INSTAAR, the University of Colorado, USA. He is an active advocate of free available, open source code of numerical models and as such responsible for the CSDMS repositories.<br/>
          He became Co-Director (2011) of the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO), currently housed at INSTAAR. For DFO he designs and implements GIS frameworks to automate free available DFO product distribution for e.g. global flood inundation maps & the status of remotely sensed gauging stations.

          <br />
          Hui is a physical oceanographer. Currently he is the deputy director of State Key Laboratory of Estuarine
          and Coastal Research. In the past 5 years his works answered the long-lasting questions on the puzzling
          dynamic behaviors of the Changjiang River plume in its alongshore and cross-shelf transports, and the unique
          tidal effects was highlighted for the first time. These works are immediately recognized by the research
          community and have received considerable citations. His technique approaches include both numerical and
          observational methods. In the numerical part, he developed the novel advection scheme HSIMT that can sufficiently
          remove the numerical dissipation and oscillations. HSIMT now has been an option of COAWST that is maintained by USGS.
          In the observational part, he developed a phasing-averaging method that can remove the tidal oscillations
          from the cruise ADCP currents. His current work concentrates on the physical-biogeochemical interactions,
          attempting to find the linkage between spatiotemporal characteristics of primitive production and the complicated
          dynamic processes in the East China Sea.

It is the second largest city in the province after the capital, Wuhan. The Three Gorges Dam is located within its administrative area, in Yiling District.[3] At the 2010 census, its population was 4,059,686 inhabitants whom 1,350,150 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of Yiling, Xiling, Wujiagang and Dianjun urban districts as Xiaoting District are not yet urbanized. </span>
